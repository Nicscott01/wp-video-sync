# WP Video Sync Project
This was started to take care of keeping video content up to date on LearnDash LMS. Because of the many videos that my client has, we wanted the abilty to add videos to a Vimeo showcase, and have that be reflected as a new/updated lesson within LearnDash.

## Todo:
- (Option) Remove a lesson if that video is removed in the showcase (do we draft it? trash it?)
- (Option) Update Course w/ showcase info (featured image, title, description )
- (Option) Sync/Map tags to WP/Learndash Cats & Tags
- (Option) Order the lessons as the showcase shows the videos
- (Option) update domain embed settings
